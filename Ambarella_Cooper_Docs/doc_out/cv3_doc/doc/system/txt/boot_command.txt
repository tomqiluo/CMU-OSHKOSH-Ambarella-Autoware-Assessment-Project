I - Introduction
----------------

Amboot supports many commands, normaly they need users to input command manually
to execute. But sometimes it's required to execute some commands automatically
before booting into Kernel, we term these commands as "boot command", abbreviated
to "bootcmd".



II - Usage
----------

Users can specify multiple commands in "bootcmd", and each commands are seperated
by semicolon.

There are below ways to setup "bootcmd":

1) Use "setenv" command, e.g., setenv bootcmd COMMAND[;COMMAND]
   PS: "setenv bootcmd" without COMMAND will clear the boot command.

2) Call env_set_bootcmd() to change the contents of the "bootcmd" storage directly.

3) If FLEXIBLE_FIRMWARE_LAYOUT is selcted, "bootcmd" is stored in env partition, so
   users can change the env partition to change "bootcmd".
