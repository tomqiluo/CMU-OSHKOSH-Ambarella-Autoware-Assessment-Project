SIGNLE BST WITH MULTIPLE INI
============================


I - Introduction
----------------

Sometimes one BST need to support several sets of boot parameters, then a single
BST can be used to cover several different boards.

Note:
  a) only the BST provided as source codes can suppor this feature.
  b) Not all parameters can be multiple, for details please see
     src/bst/$(CHIP_LO)/parameters.S.
  c) Due to BST size limitation, the number of INI files is restricted. If too
     many INI files are provided, you will see build error.


II - Usage
----------

1. Provide multiple INI files:
   All the INI files must be named as BOARD_N.ini, Here "BOARD" can be arbitrarily,
   while N is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... and etc.

2. Provide a global subroutine written in assembly codes to get board index which
   is used to select proper set of parameter. Actually here "index" is the "N" above.
   This subroutine must be named as bsp_hw_index and written in BOARD/bsp/bsp_bst.S
   PS:
      a) There are many ways to distinguish each board, e.g., by GPIO, by OTP, by
         POC and etc. It's determined by board design, so that "bsp_hw_index" must
         be provided by customers themselves.
      b) INVALID INDEX WILL CRASH THE BOOT, so you have to make sure "bsp_hw_index"
         can always return valid index.

3. Enable CONFIG_AMBST_MULTI_DRAM_INI_SUPPORT by menuconfig


III - Example of bsp_bst.S
--------------------------

Below example shows that GPIO21 is used to distinguish two boards, and the board
index (0 or 1) is returned in "w0".

Note: .globl below is MUST HAVE.

#include <ambhw/gpio.h>

.globl bsp_hw_index

bsp_hw_index:
	mov	x29, x30
	/* use GPIO21 state as index */
	ldr	w0, =(GPIO0_BASE + 21)
	bl	gpio_pin_check
	cbz	w0, 1f
	mov	w0, #1
1:	ret	x29

You can also see some examples under bsp directory for our EVK board.
