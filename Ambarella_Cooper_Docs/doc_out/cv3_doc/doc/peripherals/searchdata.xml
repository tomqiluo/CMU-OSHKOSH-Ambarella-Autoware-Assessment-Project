    <field name="text">SD Card SD Card The CV5x CV7x evaluation kit EVK board has two secure digital SD interfaces one slot is used for the SD card and the other is used for the micro SD card The two SD slots are independent they have their own SD controllers The maximum frequency of the SD controller is 1 5 0 MHz The following figure shows the bottom of the CV5x EVK Timn board Figure 1-1 SD Slots Secure digital is a non-volatile memory card format developed by the SD Card Association for use in portable devices See for further details Users can also refer to for SD card standards Figure 2-1 SD SDHC SDXC MMC Cards from Different Vendors Figure 2-2 Pins on an SD Card If the application requires storing data continuously Ambarella recommends using high speed high quality SD cards High speed high quality SD cards write data in less time and require less CPU for input output I/O The following sections provide information about SD card formats speeds and design notes Ambarella does not recommend normal-speed SD cards low-speed SD cards low-speed multi-media controller MMC cards or small-capacity SD cards for typical internet protocol camera IPCAM system designs or car DV designs As an alternative Ambarella recommends using SDHC class 4 or above for continuous data writing applications If applications require long-time continuous data writing Ambarella recommends using SDHC class

enabled for SDIO1 For CV52 CONFIG_CV52_CRCO_SELECT_SD1 should be enabled for SDIO0 and CONFIG_CV52_CRCO_SELECT_SD2 should be enabled for SDIO1 For CV5 and CV52 SW2-1 SW2-2 and SW2-3 should be set to remove J18 and connect J16 when using SDIO0 SW2-4 SW3-1 and SW3-2 should be set to remove J24 and connect J22 when using SDIO1 The CV5x board recognizes the SD card after the card is inserted into the SD card slot and it is automatically mounted to Enter mount on the CV5x board to see the mounting information NTFS file system is not supported by default To get NTFS-formatted SD cards recognized by the board enable the kernel menuconfig in bellow Before removing the SD card close all files then unmount the SD card see below If the message appears check if all files on the SD card are closed and is not being accessed type to go to the root directory Format the SD card Although the SD card may arrive pre-formatted Ambarella recommends formatting the card manually to avoid potential errors and to maximize performance The SD card can be formatted to FAT32 NTFS ext3 and other file systems For SD cards equal to or less than 3 2 GB FAT32 is recommended For SD cards larger than 3 2 GB NTFS is preferred as Windows limits FAT32 partitions to 3 2 GB Windows 7 also supports exFAT but exFAT is not formally supported by the Linux kernel Ext3 is supported on Linux to support large SDHC or SDXC cards but Windows does not recognize ext3 There are three main options to format the SD cards to the required format To successfully format an SD card the write protection lock on the side of the card must be in the position SD mini and micro SD cards must be used with an adapter or specialized USB card reader when a computer is formatting them Use a format utility Most computer systems include generic formatting utilities for nearly every format of writable media For example in the Windows operating system OS users can access the format option by right-clicking an driver in the folder Use the default setting to format the SD card The SD Association SD Formatter is the recommended option for the Windows OS platform The SD Formatter is recommended because generic-format utilities are not designed to format SD cards to their official SD memory format requirements that are required to run at optimum performance on devices The SD formatter that the SD Association offers is free and is offered at SDcard.org The tool is included in the CV5x Flexible Linux SDK The tool can format an SD card to the FAT32 format and is used to create a DOS file system under Linux If users intend to use a SD card as common data storage they must format the card in their product under Linux using mkdosfs in order to ensure optimal performance An SD card that is formatted by a different tool on Windows can potentially result in lower performance Check the file system integrity The tool is used to check and repair the MS-DOS file system The source code of dosfs is available at If the file system of the SD card is correct the output message is as follows If the SD card is removed before unmounting users must check the integrity of the file system again before using the card Removing the SD card before unmounting can cause inconsistent data storage and reduce the integrity of the file system To avoid this potential issue good product design should include unmounting the SD card before removing Alternatively it should call a poweroff command to enable the system to close all open files and flush data to sync and then unmount Partition the SD card Occasionally users must partition the SD card For example if a user must format a 6 4 GB SDXC card to the FAT32 file system note the following because Windows limits FAT32 to 3 2 GB multiple partitions are required However only the first partition can be seen on Windows while Linux can display all partitions Gparted is a software utility that scans storage devices examining the data in order to detect partitions which may exist but are absent from the disk s partition tables For more details go to If users must access all partitions in Windows Ambarella does not recommend using the Linux tool to form the partition As an alternative users can attempt to port exFAT to Linux or use NTFS on the SD card to support large partitions that can be recognized on Windows In most applications the SD card is used as local storage in which data is written However data write performance and I/O CPU usage is important if the I/O CPU usage is too high it can lead to write errors or other issues Good write performance is achieved if the CPU load in the I/O operation is less than 2 0 on average in the top command when performing a continuous write to the SD card If the write performance does not meet this average it should be checked reasons for less than optimal performance could include a slow SD card too many concurrent read write operations on the SD card insufficient I/O memory buffer or bad hardware design Check write performance Check the SD card write performance using the command dd The usage of dd can be found in the Linux user manual The results are shown above the average writing speed is 1 2 8 MB 14.36 s 8.9 MB/s Improve write performance Users can optimize the writing method to improve the write performance of the FAT32 SD card If each syscall is in multiples of 1 6 KB sizes the SD card can obtain a better write performance For a larger SD card 3 2 KB or 6 4 KB is preferred A quick solution is to write in multiples of 6 4 KB to obtain optimal performance on all SD cards If writing data of a random size the FAT32 file system may include fragments The fragments will be lower than the writing speed and the I/O operation may require more CPU resources affecting the overall write performance The prototype of the write function is as follows For the FAT32 file system Ambarella suggests that the is aligned to 6 4 KB in the code meaning that if there is not enough data it is preferred to place it into a queue and add data to increase the size to 6 4 KB The size of rootfs can be very large and flash may not have sufficient space to store it In this case users can use SD card to store rootfs The following steps use the SD card as rootfs the kernel is stored in the flash and rootfs is stored in the SD card Change rootfs to the SD card Enable initramfs and build it Amba build Generate rootfs whose type is tar Set the initramfs file path Yocto build Change the ext4 and MMC drivers to instead of Build ipcam-image and burn the image to the board Build ros rootfs Untar rootfs.tar to the SD card Insert the SD card to board and reboot it The kernel is from the flash and rootfs is from the SD card is the SD card device the actual value depends on the user s system The rootfs of Amba build is different from Yocto build it is ambarella/out/amba_out/ board Question 1 Why is the system boot speed too slow when using the customer’s board It seems to be related to the SD card interrupt Answer Check the hardware design If there is only one SD interface that is being used and no secure digital input output SDIO interface check the SD configuration file To verify if the slow boot issue is caused by the SD card do not insert ambarella_sd.ko Remove the following line from d/S11init If the issue is solved the slow boot was a result of SD detection If the issue is not solved proceed to the next troubleshooting step Check if fixed_cd is floating Ambarella recommends pulling down fixed_cd if SDIO WiFi is not used permanently If SDIO WiFi is reserved for future use and fixed_cd is floating disable SDIO WiFi detection on the software side Modify d/S11init as follows Question 2 Why do I/O errors occur after the message when recording to the SD card Answer cmd25 is WRITE_MULTIPLE_BLOCK As the SD device is busy no acknowledgement is passed after the defined time is out Try the following solutions to solve this issue Use 1 2 MHz as the SD clock frequency The SD clock quality is not good enough for some boards which may lead SD cards to being unrecognized Lowering the SD clock frequency fixes this issue Check the current SD clock frequency Modify ambarella/boards/ dts to use 1 2 MHz as the SD clock frequency Question 3 Why do or errors appear when data is recorded to the SD card over a long period of time Answer Large amounts of memory are used to record streams to the SD card or perform intensive SD written tests Therefore the free memory may be insufficient for other applications The errors mentioned above are caused when users attempt to use a large amount of memory To avoid this issue perform the following steps Dynamically allocate memory to create memory fragments making further memory allocation difficult or impossible Users should try allocating the memory consisting of large blocks to the applications and manage the memory internally The kernel reserves a dedicated amount of memory for itself to process jobs Release part of the memory to the user space Check the memory size 2 0 0 0 0 KB reserved for the kernel Check the free memory size Memory 3 2 4 8 8 K used 1 8 3 5 7 2 K free 0 K shared 0 K buffer 1 3 1 4 8 K cached Edit Note that the change will be forgotten after rebooting</field>

extensive advanced extensible interface AXI memory space for PCIe This feature is crucial for most GPUs as they typically require at least 2 5 6 MB of 6 4 bit prefetchable memory space Ambarella has tested AMD RV620 PRO Radeon HD 3 4 7 0 on CV72 As shown above the Radeon driver is employed in this case However if users possess other ATI cards that are compatible with amdgpu Ambarella recommends using them instead The amdgpu driver offers more advanced memory management features such as GTT support The GPU may require a large amount of VRAM space which is beyond the amount of Ambarella SoC PCIe AXI space that is supported For this case users should limit VRAM by adding to the kernel commandline however this is not sufficient because it only limits VRAM usage and would still require 8 1 9 2 M Therefore users should disable bar resize Note that if the amdgpu driver used is not gmc_v8_0.c users should remove the bar resize function in the correct gmc_vN_M.c If users encounter error messages such as ring gfx test failed 1 1 0 or radeon ring 0 test failed there is an issue with reading or writing to the ring buffer also known as the GPU s command buffer The specific cause of these errors can vary depending on the platform and other factors such as support for ExtTag by the upstream switch For the Ambarella platform this issue arises due to a limitation with the Cadence Gen3 PCIe controller This controller does not permit variations from its maximum pcie_master_AXI_ARSIZE value of four unless pcie_master_AXI_ARLEN is zero in a request This means that if users must read or write memory-mapped input output MMIO to the endpoint s bar they are required to use writel readl operations The use of memcpy memcpy_to fromio readq writeq operations is not allowed under these circumstances At present the radeon amdgpu driver uses the memcpy_toio memcpy_fromio functions for the ring buffer To address this issue these functions should be replaced with the 3 2 bit version of memcpy Users can easily implement this change by applying the modifications found in Coreforge s PR which introduces the 3 2 bit memcpy Alternatively users can utilize the memcpy_fromio_ambarella function that the Ambarella kernel provides It is important to note that this limitation does not only impact kernel space drivers updates to memcpy in the userspace are also necessary The GLIBC s memcpy for aarch64 is implemented in assembly and uses single instruction multiple data SIMD stp/ldp operations where possible A solution could be to implement a version of memcpy that copies four-byte chunks at one time similar to how memcpy_fromio_ambarella functions An example of how to perform this operation can be found in this Stack Overflow post To compile the shared library use the following flags fPIC g fno-inline fno-builtin-inline fno-inline-functions fno-builtin shared Users can test this library by using the LD_PRELOAD command followed by the user application Alternatively users can make the library globally available by adding its full path to the so.preload file As pointed above it is the Ambarella controller s limition but only the GPU driver requires this change because drivers such as NVMe have performed similar changes in The commit changes how NVMe storage devices are managed by the kernel specifically in relation to how 6 4 bit read write operations are managed The commit modifies the kernel s NVMe driver to use read write operations for certain storage controllers that may require ordered split transfers even on 6 4 bit machines This includes for example the NVMe controller found in certain models of Apple™ s MacBook™ The commit changes several instances in the code where readq and writeq functions were used to instead use lo_hi_readq and lo_hi_writeq respectively These changes should ensure ordered split transfers on 6 4 bit platforms which helps avoid potential issues with the aforementioned controllers Users are not required to modify the NVMe driver If desired users can attempt to undo the changes made by the commit using the following method Users will then notice that the NVMe controller ceases to function properly Users can also utilize the Ambarella pci-amba-test to validate the presence of this issue When running amba-pcitest b 0 users can see the following This also implies that attempts to access the 6 4 bit bar will be unsuccessful Some drivers for PCIe Ethernet are already in the kernel The two drivers below are selected by default After building the binary and flashing it to the EVK board the command below

acting as either an RC or EP and you encountered the issue mentioned in the title ensure that the signal lengths of the PCIe connector s P and N are the same If they are different prioritize fixing this issue by replacing the connector with one which has the same length If using a CV5 CV52 EVK verify that the PCIe switch is attached to the board   switch switch switch switch If the PCIe switch does not exist enable CONFIG_AMBOOT_PCIE_MODE_RC_QUIRK CONFIG_AMBOOT_PCIE0/1/2_MODE_RC_QUIRK for CV3 under the Ambarella software development kit SDK If the steps above do not resolve the issue check the PCIe status register PCIe status reg CV5 devmem 0 x20e0024198 CV3 PCIe0 devmem 0 xffe00241ac PCIe1 devmem 0 xffe00241b0 PCIe2 devmem 0 xffe00241b4 CV72 devmem 0 xffe003e1ac If all values are 0 verify that the PCIe controller driver has been probed In SDK 2.0 the CV52 PCIe has not been checked because its compatible is but the driver uses As a result the driver is not probed and the register receives all 0 values Update the compatible to and try again Get bit 3 2 If the value is not 0 b11 linkup completed it indicates that the controller linkup has not succeeded It is possible that some SoC pins are broken Some CV5 boards have this issue if so request a new CV5 board If the status register is functional verify that the PCIe slot powers on For example the CV5 EVK uses a PCA953x GPIO 6 for slot power control If the user s GPIO setting is incorrect and the slot does not have power the endpoint cannot be recongized Ambarella s PCIe controller can function as a regular endpoint For the

CV3 CV5 the CV72 EVK does not include level shift Perst is asserted when the RC links up and some registers such as the EP trans IB register are cleared To fix this issue Perst must be disabled This can be performed for example by removing R1125 from the CV72 EVK Note that with this rework if CV72 functions as an RC the endpoints may malfunction due to missing fundmental resets For example NVMe will receive a timeout when reading writing Users should only disable Perst remove R1125 or add a diode when CV72 functions as an EP and configures its EPF before RC bootup If the user wants to use a PC as the RC and the Ambarella chip s PCIe controller as the EP the EP must use the RC s clock source To find the root cause users can refer to here CV3 integrates three PCIe controllers PCIe0 PCIe1

switch for example to disable the clock Taiwan CV72 and CV5 BUBs have no such support The Taiwan CV3 BUB supports I2C clock generator read write Users may have a variety of reasons for preferring to use a single lane even if the SoC provides four PCIe lanes For instance in certain cases users may only require single-lane throughput for specific applications such as serial adanced technology attachment SATA controllers Users can check the PCIe status register to see if the lanes are limited to a single lane using CV5 for an example devmem 0 x20e0024198 if BIT(5:4) is 0 b00 x1 if BIT(5:4) is 0 b01 x2 if BIT(5:4) is 0 b10 x4 Depending on the specific board design it may be necessary to supply power to the slot during the PCIe controller boot-on process This can be verified within AMBoot for instance if users are utilizing GPIO 6 8 to manage the power for the slot</field>

time This is a collection of samples one per channel and is generally called a frame In other words a frame sample channel Sample format This indicates the sample format used to transfer data to or from the interface It may or may not correspond with a format directly supported by the hardware Rate For fully digital interfaces the rate indicates the speed of the clock that is used to move digital audio data to or from the outside world Interleaved A data layout arrangement samples of each channel is played at the same time so that they can follow each other sequentially See the following section non-interleaved Non-interleaved A data layout where the samples for a single channel follow each other sequentially samples for another channel are either in another buffer or another part of this buffer In contrast with the interleaved concept it responds with a format supported by the hardware Chunk size The number of frames used when transferring data to from the device hardware buffer Chunk byte Chunk byte chunk size channel Period The number of frames processed every time Buffer size The size of buffer used to store the sound data per period ALSA Architecture Application developers should focus more on the application logic and less on the implementation of the ALSA core and ALSA driver Furthermore developers must use the API functions in the ALSA-lib to achieve native ALSA support for applications The ALSA-lib documentation tutorial is a valuable developer reference to the available functions A typical audio application uses the following routine Open the device The currently designed interfaces are listed below Information interface Control interface PCM capture interface PCM playback interface ALSA does not directly operate with the interfaces listed above the most important ALSA interfaces to the PCM devices are the default plughw 0 0 and HW 0 0 interface Only HW 0 0 will interact with the and because HW 0 0 is the lowest layer interface However plughw 0 0 and default only interacts with HW 0 0 If the plughw or default interface is used the sound hardware is not important If the sound device does not support the sample rate you specify your data will be automatically converted This also applies to the sample format the access type and the number of channels For the hardware interface users must check if their hardware supports the desired configuration If the desired configuration is not supported then the application using the hardware will fail but the applications using plughw or default will still be successful because of its convertible capability The default interface fits the requirement of most applications In addition ALSA provides many PCM plugins e.g plugin copy plugin rate plugin file and etc Please see alsa-lib API document for details Users can use the function named snd_pcm_open() to open the PCM device Because using one PCM handle for both playback and capture is not possible users must configure two handles for full-duplex the sound device can be opened in the capture mode and the playback mode simultaneously they are independent Set Parameters Users must correctly set the parameters before writing reading PCM data to from the sound device Parameters are as follows Access type Sample format Sample rate Number of channels Number of periods Period size Allocate the hardware parameter structure Initialize the hardware parameter structure with the full configuration space of the soundcard Restrict the configuration space to a certain configuration with a set of functions named as follows If the hardware interface is used calls to these functions may fail if the sound device does not support the parameters you specify Apply the configuration to the PCM device pointed to by capture or playback This will also prepare the PCM device Read Write Sound Data For the interleaved access type For the non-interleaved access type Xrun underrun overrun After the audio interface begins it continues running until it is instructed to stop It will continue to generate data for the computer to use and or send data from the computer to the outside world The reasons listed below explain why the user’s program might not keep up with it For playback this can lead to a situation where the interface requires new data from the computer however because no new data exists the interface uses old data left in the hardware buffer This is called an For capture the interface may have data to deliver to the computer but nowhere to store it so it has to overwrite part of the hardware buffer that contains data the computer has not received This is called an For simplicity ALSA uses the term to refer to either of these conditions underrun or overrun If xrun occurs

OUT EPs Only 7 x IN EPs can be used for UVC USB audio class UAC purposes Each UVC uses either 1 or 2 IN EPs Each UAC uses 1 IN EP If only UVC up to 7 x UVCs can be supported in parallel if using single IN EP If UVC UAC up to 6 x UVC 1 x UAC can be supported in parallel if using single IN EP for UVC For UAC if enabling audio volume control one additional IN EP will be occupied Therefore 5 x

restart the board The following is the recommended topology between canvases and encode streams in the image audio video IAV layer which is required to match the UVC stream application Users can refer to the Lua script v6_generic_1080px2.lua and the UVC stream configuration file uvc.conf Figure 4-1 Ambarella UVC Pipeline UVC stream application is a unit test which is responsible for fetching the video frame from the IAV layer and then feeding it to Linux V4L2 The source is located under ambarella/unit_test/private/uvc_stream Before streaming the UVC set up IAV canvas and encoding 1 0 8 0 p Before streaming the UVC set up IAV canvas and encoding High-efficiency video coding HEVC 8 K Ambarella recommends using a sensor with direct 8 K resolution Configure the conf according to the actual stream Start streaming UVC 1.0 and UAC 1.0 Or start streaming UVC 1.1 and UAC 1.0 Or start streaming UVC 1.5 and UAC 1.0 Or start streaming UVC 1.0 and UAC 2.0 Or start streaming the multiple-UVCs and UAC 1.0 by USB 2.0 Note USB 2.0 UDC only has six physical endpoints 1 EP0 5 IN EPs USB 3.2 Gen2 UDC only has 1 5 physical endpoints 1 EP0 7 IN EPs 7 OUT EPs Each UVC will use two IN EPs and each UAC will use 2 IN EPs with volume control enabled If users enable the volume control while using two UVCs in USB 2.0 or three UVCs in USB 3.2 Gen2 the number of used IN EPs will exceed the number of physical IN EPs and the device will have no audio Users must disable volume control in these situations Or start streaming UVC 1.0 and UAC 1.0 by USB 3.2 Gen2 ISOC mode Or start streaming UVC 1.0 and UAC 1.0 by USB 3.2 Gen2 bulk mode Bulk mode can achieve higher transmission speed than ISOC mode Or start streaming the multiple-UVCs and UAC 1.0 by USB 3.2 Gen2 bulk mode Stop streaming UVC and UAC

is measured between sensor frame exposure and UVC streaming out it contains three parts the pipeline latency the transfer latency and the decoding latency The first two lantencies are related to the performance of Ambarella system on chip SoC and the decoding latency is highly dependent on the decoding performance of the connected PC laptop The way to measure pipeline latency from sensor capture done to image digital signal processing IDSP encode done can be found on Page ADVANCED Pipeline Latency The way to measure transfer latency from encode done to UVC frame capture done by PC host is as follows Modify the source code Build the firmware Enable UVC function 4.2 Build Firmware Support UVC Enable PTP function 2 PTP Examples on the Ambarella Platform Enable UVC_HOST application Test the
